Project Title: E-commerce Shopping Cart System
Project Description:
The E-commerce Shopping Cart System is a Java-based console application that simulates the functionality of a basic shopping cart in an online store. This project allows users to interact with a product catalog, add items to their cart, view the cart's contents, remove items, and check the total cost of their selected products. The program uses object-oriented principles by organizing products and cart functionality into separate classes.

Key Features:
Product Catalog:

A pre-defined list of products (like laptops, smartphones, headphones, etc.) is displayed to the user, where each product is defined by its ID, name, and price.
Add Product to Cart:

Users can add products to their cart by entering the corresponding product ID from the catalog.
View Cart:

Users can view all products in their cart, showing details such as the product ID, name, and price.
Remove Product from Cart:

Users can remove products from the cart by specifying the product ID.
Total Cost Calculation:

The system calculates and displays the total price of all products in the cart, including the currency symbol for the Indian Rupee (â‚¹).
Menu-driven System:

The application uses a simple text-based menu system, allowing users to choose from options such as viewing the catalog, adding/removing products, or exiting the system.
Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Data Structures: ArrayList (for storing products in the cart) and HashMap (for product catalog storage)
User Input: The application uses the Scanner class to accept user inputs.
Classes and Methods:
Product Class:

Attributes: id, name, and price.
Methods: Getters for each attribute and a toString() method for displaying product information.
Cart Class:

Attributes: A list of Product objects representing the user's selected items.
Methods:
addProduct(Product product): Adds a product to the cart.
viewCart(): Displays the list of products in the cart along with the total price.
removeProduct(int productId): Removes a product from the cart based on the product ID.
calculateTotal(): Calculates the total cost of products in the cart.
Main Class (ShoppingCartSystem):

A text-based menu system where users can select options to interact with the shopping cart system.
Use Cases:
Online Shopping Simulation: This project can serve as the foundation for an online shopping system where users can explore a catalog, manage their shopping cart, and perform checkout.
Learning Purpose: A practical project for understanding object-oriented programming in Java, handling user inputs, and implementing collections like ArrayList and HashMap.
Future Improvements:
Integration of a payment system to complete purchases.
Persistence of cart data using file handling or databases.
Enhanced product search and filtering options.
A graphical user interface (GUI) to replace the console-based input.
This project is a great introduction to building real-world applications using Java and lays the groundwork for more advanced e-commerce solutions.
